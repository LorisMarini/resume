  <p>I am a critical thinker and team-player, with distinguished people skills and a diverse technical background.
  I enjoy building stuff, sharing knowledge, and presenting in public. I like simple solutions to complex problems
  and I give my best in cross-functional roles across data analysis, software development,
  and data engineering. I get excited when ideas flow fast and technology is used to improves people’s lives.</p>
