    <h4>KEY RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    Perform cutting-edge research in experimental quantum physics, collecting and analysing
    hundreds of gigabytes of data to find novel light-matter phenomena. Build test and document
    electrical, mechanical and optical system to measure single-photon interactions. Present to
    international conferences and publish to leading scientific journals in the field.
