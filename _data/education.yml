    <h4>KEY RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    Perform citing-edge research in experimental quantum physics, collecting and analysing
    hundreds of gigabytes of data to find novel light-matter phenomena. Build test and document
    electrical, mechanical and optical system to measure single-photon interactions. Present to
    international conferences and publish to leading scientific journals in the field.

    <h4>KEY ACHIEVEMENTS</h4>
    <ul class="resume-item-list">
      <li>Invited to speak at two summer schools as well as the Max Plank Institute for Light</li>
      <li>Mentored and supervised four students in an ultrafast high-power laser laboratory</li>
      <li>Built an ultra-fast free-space optical setup to perform non-linear optical experiments on
        ultra-thin surfaces, including confocal single-photon imaging in visible and near infrared</li>
      <li>Built a single-photon HBT interferometer to measure light statistics (intensity autocorrelation),
      and a time-gated single-photon spectrometer to reconstruct spectral shape of extremely weak signals
      (partially in https://bit.ly/2rI5HqL)</li>
      <li>Devised a simulation tool to estimate the SNR of spontaneous downconversion, a quantum mechanical
       phenomenon that might occur in free-space other than in bulk (https://bit.ly/2Gqmhpm)</li>
      <li>Contributed designing a ultra-fast pulse shaper in free-space (https://bit.ly/2CklmCv)</li>
