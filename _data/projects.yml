    I wanted more personalised property recommendations that what I could find in the
    vanilla Domain app. Things like distance from childcares, train stations, parks and
    favourite beach, as well as timber floor, listing age and hotness. This project uses
    Domain and Google APIs together with public datasets to build the necessary
    dataset to rank and recommend the top 3 inspections to see in any given weekend.
